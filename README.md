# Market Making Simulator for European Options üìà

This project is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that simulates the strategy of a market maker for European options. The simulation includes dynamic quote generation, trade execution, and a delta hedging strategy to manage risk. The entire application is containerized with **Docker** for easy and consistent deployment.

The core of the simulation uses a **Geometric Brownian Motion** model to generate a realistic stock price path. The market maker agent then provides bid/ask quotes based on the **Black-Scholes** model, adjusting for inventory risk. The application provides a comprehensive performance report and visualizations of the simulation results.

## Features

* **Interactive Dashboard**: Adjust key simulation parameters like volatility, drift, and risk aversion in real-time.
* **Dynamic Quoting**: The market maker's bid/ask spread adjusts based on inventory and market conditions.
* **Delta Hedging**: See how the agent trades the underlying stock to maintain a delta-neutral position.
* **Performance Analytics**: View detailed reports and charts on Profit & Loss (P&L), inventory, and portfolio value.
* **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for seamless setup and execution.
* **Automated Testing**: Includes a CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** to automatically run unit tests on every push.
